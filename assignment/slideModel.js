Week 6 Assignment: Slide Model

At this poitn I would probably use the Lab from this week as my template, and add two buttons at the bottom for next/previous.
I might also add a few dots to indicate which slide # out of 5 you are on. I like those.

Organizing the data:

  I'll have an array of GeoJSON objects. They will all be points that will be read in and added to the map with a marker.

  I'll be using Yelp data that includes rating, number of reviews, name, address, and coordinates.
  Basically the data set is every bar in the city that matches the search term: "fireplace.""
  I'll probably identify the top rated, and most reviewed ones.

  I'd like to be able to click on a marker and change data. Maybe check off the ones I visit so they change colors.
  I'd also like to check off which have gas versus electric fireplaces, and remove the ones that don't have a fireplace at all. (stretch goal?)

  I'd like to use a slider to filter by start rating.
  Maybe a text input for number of ratings?

  Choosing your selection, or pressing search would change the inputs and refresh the array of displayed values using jQuery. Similar to the Lab.
